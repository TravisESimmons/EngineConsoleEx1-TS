{ // ### The `Engine`

//    Engines are the workhorse of the railway system.For our purposes, we need to track the train engine's **Model** (e.g.: "CP 8002"), **Serial Number** (e.g.: "48807"), **Weight** (in pounds, e.g.: 147,700), and **Horse Power** (e.g.: 4400). 


//    All of this must be stored as read-only information (it cannot be modified). Use private fields and properties with private sets.You will need a greedy constructor for this class. Create an overloaded.ToString() method for the class to display all the instance values in a comma separated value string.

//![Engine] (./ Engine - ClassDiagram.png)

//Note the following:

//-Horse Power must be a positive whole number between 3500 and 5500. HP is measured in 100 HP increments.
